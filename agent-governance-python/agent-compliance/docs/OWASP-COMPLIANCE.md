## Detailed Mapping

### ASI-01: Agent Goal Hijack

> *Attackers manipulate the agent's objectives via indirect prompt injection or poisoned inputs.*

**Mitigation:** Agent OS enforces **policy-based action interception** at the kernel level. Every agent action passes through the policy engine before execution. Unauthorized goal changes are blocked before they reach the agent's tools.

- **Policy Engine** — declarative rules controlling what agents can and cannot do
- **Action Interception** — kernel-level syscall abstraction intercepts all agent actions
- **Policy Modes** — `strict` (deny by default), `permissive` (allow by default), `audit` (log only)
- **MCP Governance Proxy** — policy enforcement for MCP tool calls

```python
from agent_os import StatelessKernel, ExecutionContext

kernel = StatelessKernel()
ctx = ExecutionContext(agent_id="my-agent", policies=["read_only"])

# This action is blocked by policy — goal hijack prevented
result = await kernel.execute(
    action="delete_database",
    params={"target": "production"},
    context=ctx,
)
# result.success = False, result.error = "Policy violation: read_only"
```

**Component:** [Agent OS](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) — `src/agent_os/policy/`, `extensions/mcp-server/src/services/policy-engine.ts`

---

### ASI-02: Tool Misuse & Exploitation

> *An agent's authorized tools are abused in unintended ways, such as exfiltrating data via read operations.*

**Mitigation:** Agent OS provides **capability-based security** inspired by POSIX. Agents are granted specific, scoped capabilities — not blanket tool access. Tool inputs are sanitized for injection patterns.

- **Capability Sandboxing** — agents receive explicit capability grants (read, write, execute, network)
- **Tool Allowlists/Denylists** — built-in strict mode blocks `run_shell`, `execute_command`, `eval`
- **Input Sanitization** — command injection detection, shell metacharacter blocking
- **`verify_code_safety`** MCP tool — checks generated code before execution

**Component:** [Agent OS](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) — capability model, MCP proxy policy rules

---

### ASI-03: Identity & Privilege Abuse

> *Agents escalate privileges by abusing identities or inheriting excessive credentials.*

**Mitigation:** AgentMesh implements **zero-trust identity** using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). Every agent has a cryptographic identity with scoped capabilities. Trust is earned, not assumed.

- **DID Identity** — `did:agentmesh:{agentId}:{fingerprint}` with Ed25519 key pairs
- **Trust Scoring** — tiered model: `Untrusted → Provisional → Trusted → Verified`
- **Delegation Chains** — track trust inheritance with verifiable credentials
- **Challenge-Response Handshake** — cryptographic authentication at connection time
- **Trust Decay** — scores degrade over time without positive signals

```python
from agentmesh import AgentIdentity

identity = AgentIdentity.create(
    name="data-analyst",
    sponsor="admin@company.com",
    capabilities=["read:data"],  # Scoped — cannot write or delete
)
```

**Component:** [AgentMesh](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) — `agent-governance-typescript/src/identity.ts`, `agent-governance-typescript/src/trust.ts`

---

### ASI-04: Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

> *Vulnerabilities in third-party tools, plugins, agent registries, or runtime dependencies that agents use to act, plan, or delegate.*

**Mitigation:** AgentMesh implements the **AI-BOM (AI Bill of Materials)** — a comprehensive standard for tracking the full AI supply chain including model provenance, dataset lineage, weights versioning, and software dependencies.

- **Model Provenance** — base model ancestry, fine-tuning history, training cutoff dates
- **Dataset Tracking** — training data, RAG sources, and evaluation benchmarks with data cards (PII status, bias assessment, consent tracking)
- **Weights Versioning** — cryptographic hashes (SHA-256), quantization records, LoRA adapter metadata, SLSA build provenance
- **Software Dependencies** — SPDX-aligned package tracking, CI security scanning (Bandit)
- **Compliance Mapping** — tracks coverage against OWASP, CSA ATF, EU AI Act frameworks
- **Cryptographic Signing** — Ed25519 signatures from sponsor and platform

```python
# AI-BOM tracks the full supply chain
ai_bom = {
    "modelProvenance": {
        "primary": {"provider": "anthropic", "model": "claude-3-sonnet"},
        "fineTuning": {"method": "LoRA", "evaluationMetrics": {"accuracy": 0.94}},
    },
    "datasets": [
        {"name": "FAQ KB", "type": "fine-tuning", "dataCard": {"piiStatus": "redacted"}},
        {"name": "Product Docs", "type": "rag-source", "updateFrequency": "weekly"},
    ],
    "weights": {"hash": "sha256:...", "format": "safetensors", "precision": "bf16"},
}
```

**Component:** [AgentMesh](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) — `docs/RFC_AGENT_SBOM.md` (AI-BOM v2.0 specification)

---

### ASI-05: Unexpected Code Execution

> *Agents trigger remote code execution through tools, interpreters, or APIs.*

**Mitigation:** Agent Runtime implements **CPU ring-inspired execution isolation**. Agents run in restricted rings with resource limits and can be terminated instantly.

- **Execution Rings (Ring 0–3)** — privilege tiers from kernel (0) to untrusted (3)
- **Resource Limits** — CPU, memory, time bounds per agent execution
- **Kill Switch** — instant termination of runaway agents
- **Saga Compensation** — automatic rollback when execution fails
- **Sandboxed Execution** — code runs in isolated contexts

**Component:** [Agent Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) — execution rings, resource management, saga orchestration

---

### ASI-06: Memory & Context Poisoning

> *Persistent memory or long-running context is poisoned with malicious instructions.*

**Mitigation:** Agent OS provides **policy-controlled virtual filesystem (VFS)** for agent memory with read-only policy enforcement and multi-model claim verification.

- **VFS Memory Policies** — `vfs://{agent_id}/mem/*` with per-agent access control
- **Policy-Protected Context** — `vfs://{agent_id}/policy/*` is read-only
- **CMVK (Cross-Model Verification Kernel)** — verifies claims across multiple AI models to detect poisoned context
- **Prompt Injection Detection** — sanitizer blocks `ignore previous instructions`, `disregard prior` patterns
- **PII Protection** — detects and redacts sensitive data in agent context

**Component:** [Agent OS](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) — VFS, CMVK verification, MCP proxy sanitizer

---

### ASI-07: Insecure Inter-Agent Communication

> *Agents collaborate without adequate authentication, confidentiality, or validation.*

**Mitigation:** AgentMesh provides **IATP (Inter-Agent Trust Protocol)** — a purpose-built secure communication layer for multi-agent systems.

- **IATP Sign/Verify** — cryptographic trust attestations for every message
- **Encrypted Channels** — all inter-agent communication is encrypted
- **Trust Scoring at Connection** — agents evaluated before communication is established
- **Reputation System** — ongoing trust tracking with decay and penalty
- **Mutual Authentication** — both sides must prove identity via challenge-response

```python
# Sign a trust attestation
attestation = iatp_sign(agent_id="sender", claim="data_verified", evidence={...})

# Verify before acting on inter-agent message
is_valid = iatp_verify(attestation, expected_signer="sender")
```

**Component:** [AgentMesh](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) — IATP protocol, trust scoring, handshake service

---

### ASI-08: Cascading Failures

> *An initial error or compromise triggers multi-step compound failures across chained agents.*

**Mitigation:** Agent SRE provides **production-grade reliability engineering** specifically designed for agent fleets.

- **Circuit Breakers** — automatic isolation of failing agents before failures cascade
- **Cascading Failure Detection** — monitors dependency chains for propagation patterns
- **SLO Enforcement** — Service Level Objectives with error budgets per agent
- **Error Budgets** — quantified failure tolerance that triggers automatic intervention
- **Canary Deploys** — gradual rollout of agent changes to detect issues early
- **OpenTelemetry Integration** — distributed tracing across multi-agent workflows

**Component:** [Agent SRE](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) — circuit breakers, SLO engine, cascading failure detection, chaos testing

---

### ASI-09: Human-Agent Trust Exploitation

> *Attackers leverage misplaced user trust in agents' autonomy to authorize dangerous actions.*

**Mitigation:** Agent OS implements **approval workflows** that require explicit human confirmation for high-risk agent actions.

- **Approval Workflows** — configurable human-in-the-loop for sensitive operations
- **Risk Assessment** — automatic classification: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`
- **Quorum Logic** — critical actions require multiple approvals
- **Expiration Tracking** — approval requests time out to prevent stale authorizations
- **`require_approval` Policy Action** — built-in policy rule for human review gates

**Component:** [Agent OS](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) — `extensions/mcp-server/src/services/approval-workflow.ts`

---

### ASI-10: Rogue Agents

> *Agents operating outside their defined scope by configuration drift, reprogramming, or emergent misbehavior.*

**Mitigation:** Agent Runtime provides **runtime behavioral monitoring** with instant kill capability, combined with AgentMesh trust decay.

- **Ring Isolation** — rogue agents are confined to their execution ring and cannot escalate
- **Kill Switch** — immediate termination of agents exhibiting rogue behavior
- **Behavioral Monitoring** — trust score decay on failures, anomaly tracking
- **Immutable Audit Trail** — hash-chain audit logs detect tampering
- **Shapley-Value Fault Attribution** — identify which agent in a multi-agent system is responsible for failures
- **Merkle Audit Trails** — cryptographic proof of agent action history

**Component:** [Agent Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) + [AgentMesh](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit) trust decay

pip install agent-governance-toolkit[full]
```

This single command installs the complete governance stack:

| Layer | Package | OWASP Risks Covered |
|-------|---------|-------------------|

## Cross-Cutting Principle: Least Agency

The **Least Agency** principle is emphasized throughout the OWASP Agentic Top 10 as a foundational design principle for secure agentic systems. It states:

> *Agents should be granted the minimum capabilities, permissions, and autonomy necessary to complete their assigned tasks.*

Our stack enforces Least Agency at every layer:

| Layer | Least Agency Mechanism |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Agent OS** | Policy engine enforces deny-by-default; agents must be explicitly granted each capability |
| **AgentMesh** | DID identity with scoped capabilities; delegation requires narrowing (child ≤ parent) |
| **Agent Runtime** | Execution rings (Ring 0–3) enforce privilege tiers; untrusted agents run in Ring 3 |
| **Agent SRE** | Resource limits and error budgets cap agent impact radius |
| **Agent Compliance** | Governance policies audit capability grants against Least Agency principle |

```python
# Example: Least Agency in action
identity = AgentIdentity.create(
    name="report-generator",
    sponsor="admin@company.com",
    capabilities=["read:reports"],  # Only what's needed — not "read:*"
)

# Delegation MUST narrow, never widen
child = identity.delegate(
    name="chart-helper",
    capabilities=["read:reports:charts"],  # Subset of parent
)
```
